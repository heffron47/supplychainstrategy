    "This script imports/utilizes the following data: weight and destination data from 22,376 shipments in the FedEx network, the transportation costs at each weight and zone for the three relevant service types (HD, GR, and E2), and the zone/transit data for each origin DC/store location.\n",

    "- The number of transit days must be 2 or below\n",
    "- The GR service is not chosen if a given shipment is below 70 lbs\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the script redistributes some shipments based on the following additional constraints (in this order):\n",
    "- Stores with shipment counts below 500 are eliminated and their shipments are reassigned to the next-lowest-cost option\n",
    "- Stores with shipment counts above 2000 are identified and shipments are reassigned until the shipment count is 2000 (with the least possible impact on cost)\n",

    "First, we will choose the lowest rate for each shipment and record the associated store/DC and service. Then, the script evaluates the shipment count at each store, increases the minimum shipment count to keep the store in consideration (called the \"limit\") by 1. Once the minimum surpasses the current shipment count at a store, that store is removed and the shipments are reassigned to the next-cheapest option via a recalculation of the best rate for every shipment. This process repeats until the minimum store count reaches 500.  While this part of the script is exhaustive, is the only way to ensure each shipment is reassigned to its most cost-effective origin location."
